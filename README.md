# ChainNotary üîóüìã

**Blockchain-Powered Certification**

*Verify Once, Trust Forever*

## Overview

ChainNotary revolutionizes document verification by transforming any certificate or document‚Äîwhether physical or digital‚Äîinto tamper-proof NFTs on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. Our solution eliminates fraud, ensures permanent accessibility, and creates universal trust in credentials.

## Vision

To make document verification as simple as taking a photo while ensuring permanent, tamper-proof authenticity through blockchain technology. We envision a world where any certificate or document‚Äîwhether physical paper or digital files stored on centralized servers‚Äîcan be instantly verified by anyone, anywhere.

## Problem We Solve
- **Certificate Fraud**: Easily forged physical certificates
- **Server Dependency**: Digital certificates trapped on institutional servers that may go offline
- **Verification Delays**: Manual verification processes taking days or weeks
- **International Recognition**: Difficulty verifying Egyptian credentials abroad
- **Lost Credentials**: Irreplaceable certificates lost due to server failures or physical damage
